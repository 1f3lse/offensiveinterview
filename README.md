# Purpose
Interview questions to screen offensive (red team/pentest) candidates

# Contributing
1. Use the standard method of forking this repository, making your changes and doing a "pull" request to have your content added
2. Create an "Issue" with your content and we will add for you.

# Organization
Questions should be organized (right now at least) in a couple different formats:

1. [Open-ended Questions](https://github.com/WebBreacher/offensiveinterview/blob/master/open.md) (these are things like "Tell me how you would...")
2. [Knowledge-based Questions](https://github.com/WebBreacher/offensiveinterview/blob/master/knowledge.md) (ones where there is a right and wrong answer ("What is CSRF and how is it different from XSS?")
3. Scenario-based questions (here you describe a situation and ask the applicant what they would do.)
4. Other (doesn't fit in another category)
