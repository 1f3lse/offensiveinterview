# Organization
Questions should be organized (right now at least) in a couple different formats:

1. [Open-ended Questions](https://github.com/WebBreacher/offensiveinterview/blob/master/open.md)
   - These questions have multiple methods of achieving a "correct" response. 
   - Examples:
      - "Describe how you would compromise a victim's laptop using a phishing attack."
      - "What would you do once you successfully got a shell on a database server?"
2. [Knowledge-based Questions](https://github.com/WebBreacher/offensiveinterview/blob/master/knowledge.md)
   - There is a specific right and wrong answer for these questions.
   - Examples:
      - "What is CSRF and how is it different from XSS?"
      - "What are the primary differences between ```netcat``` and ```ncat```?"
3. [Scenario-based Questions](https://github.com/WebBreacher/offensiveinterview/blob/master/scenario.md)
   - These questions are ones in which the interviewer sets up a situation and allows the candidate to respond. During their responses, the interviewer adds (more information | emulates a client | tells the candidate what happens when they take an action) in order to more fully understand the breadth and depth of a candidate's knowledge.
   - Examples:
      - "I have a /24 subnet on the Internet. You are a pentester. Tell me, start to finish, how you would execute this assessment."
      - "You have just compromised a Mac OS X laptop inside a corporate user subnet. Your goal is to exfiltrate Active Directory hashes. How do you accomplish this?"
4. [Other Questions](https://github.com/WebBreacher/offensiveinterview/blob/master/other.md)
   - These questions do not fit in the other categories. 
   - Examples:
      - *Right now I have no examples of this but you may!*
