# Scenario Questions #
*These questions have no right and wrong answer. They should allow the candidate to provide full responses. The interviewers here are not just looking for complete answers but also keeping track of HOW a candidate responds (rambles, gets distracted, doesn't answer the question, etc.).*

### General Pentest ###
1. I am your customer. I have a /24 subnet of hosts on the Internet that I'd like you to pentest. Take me through, in detail, all the steps that you will go through in this assessment. *@webbreacher* 
    1. *This question is good to not only see if the candidate thinks about pre-assessment things like Rules of Engagement and Scoping meetings, but the interviewer can (and should!) say "Tell me more about that..." each step of the way to ensure that the candidate gives sufficiently deep answers.*
    2. *The interviewer should have an idea of where they want the assessment to go, "You ran your scan and found two servers. One has TCP ports 23, 53, 80 open and the other has 80, 443 and 3306. What do you do next?" Provide direction but don't lead.*
3. For in-person interviews I like asking the candidate to go to a white board (or paper taped to the wall). I ask them to draw the most secure corporate network they can. It must have certain components which you provide. Keep them general like: User subnet, AD server, Web server (with backend database) on the Internet, Human Resources systems, Wifi, VPN, etc.
