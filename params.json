Use the standard method of forking this repository, making your changes and doing a \"pull\" request to have your content added\r\n2.

Open-ended Questions (these are things like \"Tell me how you would...\")\r\n2. Discrete Questions (ones where there is a right and wrong answer (\"What is CSRF and how is it different from XSS?\")\r\n3. Scenario-based questions (here you describe a situation and ask the applicant what they would do.)\r\n4. Other (doesn't fit in another category)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
